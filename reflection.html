                <p>The concept of responsive design is a very essential part of web development in today's modern world
                    where the users access a website from devices of various screen sizes and resolutions. Responsive
                    design is basically a practice of developing websites with flexible design and which adjusts the
                    contents of the web page automatically according to the display size of the device on which it is
                    accessed. The concept of Responsive web design also makes sure to keep the contents of the webpage
                    the same across all the devices. Responsive design makes the webpage look attractive and much more
                    accessible across a variety of devices like a phone, desktop, or tablet. Responsive design makes it
                    possible to display the contents of a webpage in different formats across devices of different
                    screen sizes.</p>

                <p>Responsive design uses breakpoints to adjust the layout of a site and determines how the contents
                    should be displayed on the screen. A certain limit of a breakpoint is determined and a particular
                    design is displayed according to the set of rules which are determined to display the contents in
                    that limit of breakpoints. The breakpoints are mostly determined by the width of the browser. A
                    responsive web page restructures its page elements as the width/viewport of the browser shrinks or
                    expands or a certain breakpoint is reached, depending on the device the webpage is accessed on. For
                    example, a webpage that displays three columns on a desktop version displays two columns on a tablet
                    and one single column on a smartphone. Without the concept of Responsive design, the same
                    three-column webpage would be displayed across all the devices of different display sizes and the
                    user of a tablet or a smartphone would have to scroll vertically as well as horizontally to view all
                    the contents of the webpage and minimize the user experience. Responsive design also reduces code
                    redundancy as we don't need to code different HTML and CSS for different device types instead we
                    just use a single HTML and CSS for different devices along with media queries and responsive grids.
                    There are many popular frameworks like Bootstrap, foundation, skeleton, and many more which makes
                    the development of responsive webpage much faster and easier.</p>

                <p>Through my research of building web apps for different devices, I learnt that it is very important to
                    test the webpage on as many devices of different display sizes and check if the webpage is optimally
                    displayed as expected and no content is overflowed. If there is an overflow of contents or the
                    webpage is not displayed responsively, it might result in a poor user experience. An optimal webpage
                    would be one that has only vertical scrolling on all the devices.</p>

                <p>In this course, I learnt so much about designing web pages through front-end web technologies like
                    HTML, CSS and Javascript. As a beginner, at first, I learned that HTML is used to give the basic
                    structure to the webpage, CSS to add style to the webpage, and Javascript to add functionality. I
                    was also able to learn about the concept of DOM, through which I can access and manipulate a web
                    document. This course also made me capable of creating a full website from scratch using HTML, CSS,
                    and Javascript. By the end of this course, I am successful in creating a website with form
                    validation majorly using Javascript and HTML pattern attributes. Through this final assessment
                    project, I learnt so much about form validation using Javascript and its implementation.</p>
